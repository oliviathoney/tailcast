    question: "What should I expect in my first session?",
    answer:
      `
      Our Physical Therapists will take you through a comprehensive initial evaluation that will
      consist of a sport specific movement assessment and special tests to get to the root of your
      injuries or impairments. Then we will discuss findings and together we will develop a plan of
      care to get you back to your sport as soon and as safely as possible. We may perform manual
      therapy techniques and corrective therapeutic interventions as well.
      `
  },
  {
    question: "What are our sessions like?",
    answer:
      `
      We will always start with an initial discussion to hear your wins and sticks. At OVERTIME, we
      value assessments. We will assess and reassess so we can celebrate the wins. Typically, we will
      start with hands-on/manual therapy techniques consisting of various tools that we have on site.
      We will then follow up with corrective exercises and movements to address impairments and get
      you back stronger.
